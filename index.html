        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>"With over a decade of experience, I specialize in leading complex projects and programs 
        while driving product lifecycles from inception to completion. I've delivered results across 
        the construction, IT, software, and DoD industries by turning ideas into impact and ensuring strategic 
        execution. My passion for learning and tackling new challenges has driven success for my teams and 
        portfolios. Because of this passion, I've cultivated skills that enable me to pickup tickets
        with the teams and work along side them. Most recently, Iâ€™ve embraced web development as a new skill, and 
        this site is my way of showcasing that journey. Thanks for stopping by!"

        <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Leading from the front.</h3> 
            While not always possible, I prefer to dive in when I can and be involved in the work, working 
            left of my developer/engineer peers.</li>
            <li><h3>Being technical.</h3> 
            There is a lot of success you can find with your SMEs with the right soft skills,
            but it's important to be open-minded and willing to learn. It's also difficult to provide direction when 
            you're not up to speed on the basics, which can cause chaos and sign you and your teams up for difficult
            tasks.
            </li>
            <li><h3>People first.</h3> 
            The best way to get the best out of people is by allowing them to flourish. How to do this can 
            widely vary from team to team, or even from person to person. Also, replacing personnel can be
            extremely costly, from the time it takes to recruit, to teaching the necessary technical skills, and
            developing the necessary organizational knowledge.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Agility</h3>
            Agility and Adaptability is important for individuals to rise up and meet new challenges, whether
            it's building a new skill or new relationships. It's also important to teams to ensure peak 
            performance and maximum innovation.
